## Purpose

Vehicle Insurance Fraud is an expensive, increasingly common, and avoidable problem for insurers. Sophisticated fraud detection processes will be essential to the entire Financial Services Industry moving forward. That’s why this project seeks to use machine learning techniques to understand and predict fraud.

## Questions to Answer

- Can we accurately predict whether an insurance claim is fraudulent?
- Which features are correlated with higher likelihood of fraud?

### Our Data

Our dataset was generated by Angoss KnowledgeSEEKER, a provider of systems for predictive analytics, and found on Kaggle.

This set features over 15,000 claim samples with 33 columns, including information on:

-Demographics of claimant
-Details on the vehicle in question
-Information about the claimants’ policies.
-Whether fraud was detected
